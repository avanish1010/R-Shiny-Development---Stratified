# R-Shiny-Development---Stratified
This repository demonstrates a stratified sampling framework in R for estimating the population mean. It compares proportional, Neyman, and optimized allocation methods while incorporating stratum-wise variability, survey cost, time, and sampling bias. The project provides a practical and reproducible approach to efficient sample size determination.
